Using "two pointer" technique.

Explanation : The code checks if the `ransomNote` can be constructed using letters from the `magazine`. It sorts both strings to align characters in ascending order, then uses a two-pointer approach. Pointer `pointer1` iterates through `ransomNote`, and `pointer2` iterates through `magazine`. Whenever the characters at both pointers match, both pointers are incremented; otherwise, only `pointer2` moves forward to find a match. If `pointer1` reaches the length of `ransomNote`, it means all characters in `ransomNote` are present in `magazine` in sufficient quantity, and the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Code : 
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        int pointer1 = 0, pointer2 = 0;
        sort(magazine.begin(),magazine.end());
        sort(ransomNote.begin(),ransomNote.end());
        for (int i=0;i<magazine.length();i++){
            if(ransomNote[pointer1] == magazine[pointer2]){
                pointer1++;
                pointer2++;
            }
            else{
                pointer2++;
            }
        }
        if(pointer1 == ransomNote.length()){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }
};
